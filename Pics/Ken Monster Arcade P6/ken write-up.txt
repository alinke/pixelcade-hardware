A big thanks to Ken for sharing pics of his recent Pixelcade installation. 
Ken has a 2 Player custom cab from Monster Arcade:   https://www.monsterarcades.com/copy-of-monster-upright-43-4-pl  and 
is using GameEx Arcade for his front end on Windows. His control panel is mainly Ultramarc controls and 
he's using LEDBlinky for both the Pixelcade marquee and to control his LED Buttons via an I-PAC Ultimate.
